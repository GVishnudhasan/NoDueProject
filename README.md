<h1>Project Overview</h1>

This project is a web application that automates the process of requesting and approving no-due certificates for students at the end of each semester. 

**Features**

* **User Roles:** The system supports different user roles: Students and Faculty Members. Each role has specific privileges.
* **Student Dashboard:** Students can view a list of their subjects, handling faculty, and request no-due certificates for each subject.
* **Faculty Review:** Faculty members can review student requests, approve or reject, and view all pending requests they are responsible for.
* **Approval Workflow:** Once all faculty members approve a request, it gets sent to the Head of Department (HoD) for final approval.
* **Digital Signature:** The HoD can provide a digital signature for approved certificates.
* **Seamless Access:** Students can track the approval status and write exams upon final approval.
